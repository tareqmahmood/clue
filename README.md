```

## üéØ How It Works

Once installed, clue integrates with your bash prompt and automatically displays tips based on your command usage:

```bash
$ ls -la
total 24
drwxr-xr-x 3 user user 4096 Sep  7 10:30 .
drwxr-xr-x 5 user user 4096 Sep  7 10:29 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user  123 Sep  7 10:30 file.txt

$ cd projects

$ pwd
/home/user/projects

$ git status
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean

$ ls

[clue tip #23 - beginner]
Use `head` to see the first 10 lines of a file. Great for checking file headers or previewing content.
Example: head filename.txt

$ 
```

## üîß Usage

### Automatic Mode
Tips appear automatically every 5 commands (configurable). No action needed!

### Manual Mode
```bash
# Show random tip from current mode
clue

# Show tip from specific difficulty level
clue -m beg           # Beginner tips
clue -m int           # Intermediate tips
clue -m adv           # Advanced tips
clue -m all           # Random tip from any level

# Full names also work
clue -m beginner
clue -m intermediate
clue -m advanced

# Show specific tip by number
clue -i 15            # Show tip #15 from current mode

# Help
clue -h
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Edit `~/.clue/config.sh` to customize settings:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# clue configuration

# Interval between tips (number of commands)
CLUE_INTERVAL=20

# Default mode (beg, int, adv, all)
# Aliases: beginner, intermediate, advanced, all
CLUE_MODE=beg
```

### Configuration Options

- **CLUE_INTERVAL**: How many commands between automatic tips (default: 5)
- **CLUE_MODE**: Default difficulty level
  - `beg` (or `beginner`): Basic file operations, navigation, text viewing
  - `int` (or `intermediate`): Advanced searching, text processing, system tools
  - `adv` (or `advanced`): Complex scripting, process management, network tools
  - `all`: Random tips from any difficulty level

## üìñ Sample Tips

### Beginner Level
```
[clue tip #12 - beginner]
Use `ls -lh` to see human-readable file sizes instead of raw bytes. The -h flag makes output much more readable.
Example: ls -lh
```

### Intermediate Level  
```
[clue tip #45 - intermediate]
Use `find` with `-type f` to search only for files, or `-type d` for directories. Much more precise than basic find.
Example: find /path -type f -name "*.txt"
```

### Advanced Level
```
[clue tip #78 - advanced]
Process substitution with `<()` lets you use command output as if it were a file. Powerful for complex pipelines.
Example: diff <(sort file1) <(sort file2)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Options

### Remote Installation (Recommended)
```bash
curl -s https://tareqmahmood.github.io/clue/install.sh | bash
```

### Local Installation (Development)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tareqmahmood/clue.git

## üìÅ File Structure

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ intermediate.txt # Intermediate tips

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ uninstall.sh     # Uninstall script
```

## üóëÔ∏è Uninstall

To completely remove clue from your system:
